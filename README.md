### Column descriptions:
"site": unique ID corresponding to each 1.4 ha stem-mapped forest plots (n = 14)

"scale": Spatial scale (square meters) at which all metrics were calculated (n = 11 / per site)

"aPIE": tree alpha diversity calculated at each spatial scale

"bPIE": tree beta diversity calculated at each spatial scale

"gPIE": tree gamma diversity calculated at each spatial scale

"biomass": total biomass (kg) of all trees with stem diameter > 2.5 cm at each spatial scale

"env": Soil resources and topography at each spatial scale (dimensionless; first principal component from 14 variables)
