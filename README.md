Data, metadata, and code to analyze relationships between tree diversity and biomass across scales. accepted at Ecology: Reu et al. beta diversity as a driver of forest biomass across scales. Ecology (in press)


## Metadata
file: trcp_bef_data_final.csv

Data were collected between 2016-2017 at the Tyson Research Center in Missouri, USA

### Column descriptions:
"site": unique ID corresponding to each 1.4 ha stem-mapped forest plots (n = 14)

"scale": Spatial scale (square meters) at which all metrics were calculated (n = 11 / per site)

"aPIE": mean tree alpha diversity calculated at each spatial scale. Site means were calculated by averaging across all subsamples for a given spatial scale (Fig 2.) 

"bPIE": mean tree beta diversity calculated at each spatial scale. Site means were calculated by averaging across all subsamples for a given spatial scale (Fig 2.)

"gPIE": mean tree gamma diversity calculated at each spatial scale. Site means were calculated by averaging across all subsamples for a given spatial scale (Fig 2.)

"biomass": total biomass (kg) of all trees with stem diameter > 2.5 cm at each spatial scale

"env": Soil resources and topography at each spatial scale (dimensionless; first principal component from 14 variables)
